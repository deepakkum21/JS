# JS (Javascript)

## Synchronous single threaded lang

1. **Everything in JS happens `inside the execution engine`**.
2. This execution environment has two components:-
   1. **Memory component/ variable environment**
      - it stores all the variable (in form of key value) and functions.
   2. **Code component/ Thread of execution**
      - it is the place where code is executed.
      - it is single thread where code is executed one line at a time.
